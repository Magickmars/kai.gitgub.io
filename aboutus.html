      <h2>Our story</h2>
      <p>Nestled in the heart of sunny Hawkes Bay, *Kai and Coffee* has been a favourite gathering place for locals since its doors first opened in 2015. The café was co-founded by John Smith and husband-and-wife team Theresa and Piripi Ngata, a partnership that beautifully blends modern and traditional values.</p>
      <p>Their vision? To nourish body and soul by combining "kai," the Māori word for food, with the universal love of coffee. It’s more than just a place to grab a bite; *Kai and Coffee* is an experience rooted in the land and its history.</p>
      <p>Hawkes Bay is renowned for its beauty, but it’s the rich cultural heritage of the region that truly sets it apart. The area has long been home to the Ngāti Kahungunu iwi, one of New Zealand's largest iwi. For centuries, the iwi’s connection to the land has been a source of strength and sustenance, with fertile soil and an abundant coastline providing the means for traditional fishing, gardening, and foraging for native plants. It’s this heritage that the café honours in every dish they serve.</p>
      <p>The café’s menu is a tribute to Māori culinary traditions, infused with a modern twist. They source fresh, local ingredients, often native to the region, and present them with a dash of creativity. From fresh fish to kawakawa-infused teas, the menu speaks to the café’s deep respect for the land and its people.</p>
      <p>But what truly sets *Kai and Coffee* apart is how they honour the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in their daily operations. They are committed to biculturalism, integrating Māori values into the core of their business. This means not only supporting local Māori suppliers but also offering bilingual service in te reo Māori and English. The café’s motto, *"Whangaihia to tinana ki te kai organic"*, meaning "nourish your body with organic kai," is proudly displayed in both languages, reminding visitors of the café’s commitment to inclusion and respect for Māori culture.</p>
      <p>John and the Ngata family have created more than just a café—they’ve built a community hub that celebrates the rich cultural tapestry of Hawkes Bay. It’s a place where you can sip on a beautifully brewed coffee, enjoy a slice of mānuka honey cake, and feel connected to the land and its history.</p>
